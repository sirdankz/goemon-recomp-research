# Slides

You have an online slide deck (Reveal.js) packaged inside the docs build.

- Open the deck: **`https://sirdankz.github.io/goemon-recomp-research/slides/reveal/index.html`**
- Tip: use arrow keys, press **Esc** for overview.

If that link 404s, it usually means the `docs/slides/reveal/` folder wasn’t included in the MkDocs build output yet.
